            <p class="descrip-left">Marsha “Pay it no Mind” Johnson, a transgender woman, was an LGBTQ+ history icon who helped spark the Stonewall Riots in 1969. The Stonewall Riots marked the beginning of a new and powerful phase in the movement for LGBT rights. With Sylvia Rivera, another transgender activist, Marsha established the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.), an organization dedicated to helping the homeless LGBT youth of New York City; they provided a safe-space for them along with shelter and support. Marsha was tragically murdered in 1992, however, authorities deemed her death a suicide, and her case was quickly closed.</p>

Alongside fellow LGBTQ+ activists, at the young age of seventeen, she helped incite the Stonewall Riots; this riot helped lead to monumental progressions in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. She was very involved in helping her community, for example, Sylvia and her friend Marsha P. Johnson, another LGBT history icon, established the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.). Sylvia was also the co-founder of the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activists Alliance in New York City.

        <p class="descrip-left">Alan Turing is often named as the father of computer science. He studied mathematics at King’s College and Princeton. During World War II, he was recruited into British communications. He created a device called the Bombe Machine that could decrypt the German’s Enigma code. His achievements during the war were kept secret, so he didn’t receive credit for his influential work. In 1948, he began doing research for computer development at Manchester University. In 1952, Turning was arrested for having an affair with another man. He was forced to take oestrogen injections, intended to suppress his attraction to men, to avoid jail time. He died in 1954 from cyanide poisoning, which is often ruled as a suicide.</p>

The year after he was elected, he, and the city’s mayor, were shot and killed by a former city supervisor named Dan White.

White faced a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and not first degree murder.</p>

        <p class="descrip-left">Edith Windsor was an LGBT+ rights activist and the lead plaintiff in the 2013 case, the United States v. Windsor. She was married to her long term partner, Thea Clara Spyer, in 2007 in another country, and when Spyer passed away in 2009, Windsor went to court to obtain a tax refund. Since same sex marriage wasn’t legally accepted in the US, the courts refused her since she and her late wife weren’t seen as married because of the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996. Windsor sued as only recognizing heterosexual marriages and not homosexual marriages was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 in a 5-4 ruling as “no person shall be ‘deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law’” (The New York Times).</p>

D'Éon was exiled from France to London until King Louis XV died in 1774, and his son issued Pierre Beaumarchais to represent the French government. After long discussion, d'Éon signed an agreement that all of the spy work the Chevalier possessed would be returned and she would return to France, and in return the king would pay some of the Chevalier’s debt and publicly recognize d'Éon as a woman.</p>
